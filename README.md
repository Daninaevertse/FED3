## Feeding Experimentation Device version 3 (FED3)

### FED3 is a wireless, battery-powered device designed for home-cage training of mice in operant tasks. Mice interact with FED3 through two nose-pokes, and FED3 responds to the mice with visual stimuli, auditory stimuli, and pellets. FED3 has an analog output that allows it to synchronize with and control external equipment. A screen provides feedback to the user, and all behavioral events are logged to an on-board microSD card. The default code includes 12 built-in programs, but FED3 is open-source and hackable, and can be easily modified to perform other tasks.
