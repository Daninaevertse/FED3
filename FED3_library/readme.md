## This is the FED3 library, version 1.0.1 (beta)
This library is in development and almost certainly contains bugs, please only use it for testing purposes. Documentation is pending.

The goal of this library is to automate most of the housekeeping functions of FED3 behind the scenes, and let the user focus on writing the behavioral control.  

## Installation instructions
1. Download the supporting libraries for FED3: [FED3_support_libraries.zip](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3/raw/master/FED3_library/FED3_support_libraries.zip). Unzip the contents of this file to your Arduino libraries folder (usually located at: Documents\Arduino\libraries). 

2. Download this directory as a zip file

3. Open the Arduino IDE and install the FED3 library by clicking Sketch > Include library > Add .ZIP library 
![AddLibary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3/master/photos/AddZipLibrary.bmp)

A window will pop up.  Navigate to FED3.zip and click install.  This will install the FED3 libary in your Arduino IDE.

4. Install all FED3 library dependencies (in /extras)

5. Re-start the Arduino IDE

5. When you open it again you should find the FED3 examples under File > Examples > FED3.  There are currently 3 examples, including "Classic FED3" which mimics the normal function of FED3, with the built-in programs.
