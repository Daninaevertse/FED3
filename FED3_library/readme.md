This is the FED3 library, BETA version 0.0.1

The goal of this library is to operate most of the housekeeping functions of FED3, and let the user focus on writing only the behavioral control.  

#This is in active development, more documentation is coming.

## Installation instructions
To install the FED3 library, download the libary file as [FED3.zip](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3/blob/master/FED3_library/FED3.zip). Save this anywhere on your computer.
