This is the FED3 library, BETA version 0.0.1!  This code is new and almost certainly contains bugs, please only use it for testing purposes.

#The goal of this library is to operate most of the housekeeping functions of FED3, and let the user focus on writing only the behavioral control.  This is in active development, better documentation is pending.

## Installation instructions
1. First download the support libraries FED3 need as [FED3_libraries.zip](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3/blob/master/FED3_library/FED3_support_libraries.zip). Unzip the contents of this to your Arduino libraries folder (usually this is: Documents\Arduino\libraries). 

2. Next download the FED3  libary, [FED3.zip](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3/blob/master/FED3_library/FED3.zip). Save this anywhere on your computer. 

3. Open the Arduino IDE and install the FED3 library by clicking Sketch > Include library > Add .ZIP library 
![AddLibary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3/master/photos/AddZipLibrary.bmp)

Navigate to FED3.zip and click install.  This will install the FED3 libary in your Arduino IDE.

4. Re-start the Arduino IDE

5. When you open it again you should find the FED3 examples under File > Examples > FED3.  There are currently 3 examples, including "Classic FED3" which should mimic the normal function of FED3.

6. Play around and send feedback if you find bugs!
