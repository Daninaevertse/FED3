This page contains early PCB designs for "operant FED", which we later started calling "FED3".  This was the first PCB made in the Kravitz lab, designed to work by mounting Adafruit breakout boards to the PCB with headers.  Here is a render of version 7, which was one of the first board designs that worked.
