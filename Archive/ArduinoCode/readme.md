If you'd like to update and modify the code for FED3 you will need to install the Arduino IDE and the FED3 library.  See [here](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3_library) for instructions.

Early versions of the FED3 code are in the "old_versions" folder, but most users should use the most recent library version.
