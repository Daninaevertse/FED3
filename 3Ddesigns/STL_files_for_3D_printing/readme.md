Download these files and slice them for your 3D printer.  These should be printed in the orientation they are in, and only the housing will need supports to print.  Try printing them slowly and at high quality for best results.  The critical parts to print well are the housing and the disk, as these parts form the dispensing mechanism. The print quality of the lid and covers won't affect function. <br>

Two files are included for the SD door - if you have an older FED3 circuit board with the large BNC connector print "FED3.1_Aug2021_SDdoor_BNC.stl", if you have a newer circuit board with a 3.5mm audio jack print "FED3.1_Aug2021_SDdoor_Audio.stl". All other parts work for both ciruit boards.
