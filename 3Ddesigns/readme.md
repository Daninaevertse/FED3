Download the .stl files and slice them for your 3D printer. The other folders are for advanced users, including some CNC parts, Solidworks files, and older designs.

3D parts should be printed in the orientation they are in in the .stl files, the housing and side door will require supports to print. Try printing parts slowly and at high quality for best results. The critical parts to print well are the housing and the disk, as these parts form the dispensing mechanism. Do not use a raft on the disk, you want a smooth flat bottom surface.

Two .stl files are included for the SD door - if you have an older FED3 circuit board with the large BNC connector print "FED3.1_Aug2021_SDdoor_BNC.stl", if you have a newer circuit board with a 3.5mm audio jack print "FED3.1_Aug2021_SDdoor_Audio.stl". All other parts work for both ciruit boards.

Finally, the editable TinkerCAD files are [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0QaiVw7KR3Y) if you want to mess with them!
